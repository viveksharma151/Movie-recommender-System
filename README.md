# Movie-recommender-System
A machine learning model to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings and movie features. Implemented collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to predict user preferences and suggest relevant movies.



## 📘 Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommender System** using machine learning techniques.  
The model provides **personalized movie recommendations** for users based on their ratings and movie features.

It uses **collaborative and content-based filtering**, with an optional hybrid approach to improve prediction accuracy.  
> ⚠️ This repository contains only the model, not a full web or mobile application.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🧠 **Recommendation Model**: Suggests movies based on user preferences and viewing history.  
- 🌲 **Collaborative Filtering**: Finds similarities between users to predict movie ratings.  
- ✍️ **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those a user liked previously.  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data, encodes movie features, and normalizes ratings.  
- 📊 **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics like RMSE, MAE, and ranking metrics to measure recommendation quality.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- **Collaborative Filtering** – Predicts user preferences based on similar users/items.  
- **Content-Based Filtering** – Uses movie attributes (genre, cast, keywords) to recommend similar movies.  
- **Hybrid Approach** – Combines collaborative and content-based predictions for better accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)  
- **Size**: 45,000+ ratings from 2,000+ users and 3,000+ movies  
- **Features**: User ID, Movie ID, Rating, Movie Title, Genre  
- **Target**: Predicted ratings for unseen movies to generate recommendations

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data preprocessing and manipulation  
  - `scikit-learn`, `surprise` – Collaborative & content-based filtering, evaluation  
  - `pickle` – Save/load trained model  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization

## 🔍 Model Workflow

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing ratings and movie metadata  
- Encode categorical features (genres, movie IDs)  
- Normalize ratings for better model performance  

### 🧮 Feature Extraction
- Use movie attributes and user ratings as input features  
- Apply similarity measures (cosine similarity, Pearson correlation)  

### 🧠 Model Training
- Train collaborative filtering and content-based models  
- Optionally combine models into a hybrid approach  

### 📈 Evaluation
- Evaluate using **RMSE, MAE**, or ranking metrics  
- Compare performance of collaborative vs content-based predictions

## 📈 Results
- ✅ Successfully recommends personalized movies for users  
- ⚡ Shows high relevance in predicted ratings using hybrid approach  
- 📊 Ready for integration with larger applications or datasets  

---

## 🧾 Future Improvements
- Integrate **deep learning models** (e.g., neural collaborative filtering) for better predictions  
- Expand dataset with additional user interactions and metadata  
- Deploy as a **web or mobile application** for real-time recommendations  
- Visualize recommendation patterns with interactive dashboards
